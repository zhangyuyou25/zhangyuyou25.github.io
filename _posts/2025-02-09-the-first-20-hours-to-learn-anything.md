Specific Methods
 * Deconstruct the Skill: Break the skill down into smaller, manageable components.
 * Learn Enough to Self-Correct: Learn enough to know when you're making a mistake.
 * Remove Barriers to Practice: Eliminate anything that prevents you from practicing.
 * Practice Consistently: Practice for at least 20 hours.
Important Considerations
 * Limit Resources: Don't try to learn from too many sources at once, as this can be overwhelming.
 * Incorporate Interests: Combine your favorite distractions with the new activity to stay motivated.
